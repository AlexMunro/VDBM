# VDBM
## Visual Database Modeller - a database CASE tool

VDBM was a project developed in early 2014 as part of an Honours project investigating the use of CASE tools for database design and generation. The aim of this tool was to build a common visual langauge based on entity-relational diagrams to unite heterogeneous database models such as 
* the standard relational model
* [the object-relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_database)
* [the functional data model](https://code.google.com/archive/p/xfdm/) 

with a view to being easily extensible to support other data models.

VDBM currently allows users to create database models, generate database creation statements and build [queries by examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_by_Example).
